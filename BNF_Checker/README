bnf_chk - BNF Syntax Checker
============================

Copyright 2006 by Umberto Salsi <salsi@icosaedro.it>

The source code of the program is written in the M2 programming language
(http://www.icosaedro.it/m2). This package includes the binary executable,
but if you need to recompile from the source, you will need the M2
developing system too.

To run the program, you need the conservative garbage collector libgc.a
from Hans Boehm. It can be downloaded from:

	http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/

Compile and install gc. On some systems this library is already installed:
please check for the presence of the file libgc.a (locate libgc.a).

Run the program with the option --help for a brief explanation of the
other options.

Enjoy!
